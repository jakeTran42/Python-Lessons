1. Please read up on this article https://stackabuse.com/big-o-notation-and-algorithm-analysis-with-python-examples/ to understand a bit more about big O notation.

2. Answer this quiz https://brilliant.org/practice/big-o-notation/ try to understand it internally before looking up explaination

### Practice questions

1. Given an array of integers, return indices (index) of the two numbers so that they add up to a specific target (assuming no repeating number). After solving the problem, please explain your solution approach and what is the big O notation for your solution. Explain in details all parts of your solution and their big O complexity.

```python 
example_arr = [2,3,1,8,6,7]
sum_index(example_arr, 7)

>>> [2, 4]
Answer: index 2 and 4 in the array add up to 7
Analysis: the big O notation for this solution is ___ because ___
```

2. Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases. After solving the problem, please explain your solution approach and what is the big O notation for your solution. Explain in details all parts of your solution and their big O complexity.

A Palindrome is something you can read backward and forward the same.

```python
Input: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Analysis: the big O notation for this solution is ___ because ___
```

3. Ensure that the first and last names of people begin with a capital letter. After solving the problem, please explain your solution approach and what is the big O notation for your solution. Explain in details all parts of your solution and their big O complexity.

```python
Input: capitalized(chris alan)

>>> Chris Alan
Analysis: the big O notation for this solution is ___ because ___
```
