1. Please read up on this article https://stackabuse.com/big-o-notation-and-algorithm-analysis-with-python-examples/ and https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-time-complexity-with-python-examples-2bda6e8158a7to understand a bit more about big O notation.

### Examples

Constant Time O(1) - The program will identify if **a** will match the string hello and will run one **once**. If a does not equal "Hello" then it will skip to the else and run that **once**. This will produce a constant run time which will be the fastest you are able to produce.

```python
if a == "Hello":
  print("World")
else:
  print("None")
```

Linear Time O(n) - The program runtime will be **linear** to the size of the array(arr) and will loop/run as many time as the number of element inside the array. If **arr** have 1 million elements, it will run 1 million times. 

```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

for i in range(len(arr)):
  print("Hello World")
```

Quadratic Time O(n^2) - An algorithm is said to have a quadratic time complexity when it needs to perform a linear time operation for each value in the input data. This basically means for every element of an array you loop through, you will do an additonal **nested** loop for that element. In simpler term, a loop inside the loop.

```python
arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
arr2 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']

for i in range(len(arr1)):
  for j in arr2:
    print(i + j)
    # Youre basically printing all of the alphabet letter in arr2 for every number inside arr1 so you can see why it will be N^2
```

Exponential Time (2^n) - The growth doubles with each addition to the input data set. 

A good example of this would be the recursive function to solve the fib sequence we did earlier. Everytime we needed to call the function again, we need to split it into two separate operation which can get large very quickly.

### Practice questions

1. Given an array of integers, return indices (index) of the two numbers so that they add up to a specific target (assuming no repeating number). After solving the problem, please explain your solution approach and what is the big O notation for your solution. Explain in details all parts of your solution and their big O complexity.

```python 
example_arr = [2,3,1,8,6,7]
sum_index(example_arr, 7)

>>> [2, 4]
Answer: index 2 and 4 in the array add up to 7
Analysis: the big O notation for this solution is ___ because ___
```

2. Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases. After solving the problem, please explain your solution approach and what is the big O notation for your solution. Explain in details all parts of your solution and their big O complexity.

A Palindrome is something you can read backward and forward the same.

```python
Input: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Analysis: the big O notation for this solution is ___ because ___
```

3. Ensure that the first and last names of people begin with a capital letter. After solving the problem, please explain your solution approach and what is the big O notation for your solution. Explain in details all parts of your solution and their big O complexity.

```python
Input: capitalized(chris alan)

>>> Chris Alan
Analysis: the big O notation for this solution is ___ because ___
```

4. Given two sorted integer arrays arr1 and arr2, merge arr1 into arr2 as one array. After solving the problem, please explain your solution approach and what is the big O notation for your solution. Explain in details all parts of your solution and their big O complexity.

```python
Input:
arr1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3
arr2 = [2,5,6],       n = 3

Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
Analysis: the big O notation for this solution is ___ because ___
```

5. Given two strings string1 and string2 , write a function to determine if string2 is an anagram of string1. Anagram is a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another. After solving the problem, please explain your solution approach and what is the big O notation for your solution. Explain in details all parts of your solution and their big O complexity.

```python
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"

Output: true
Analysis: the big O notation for this solution is ___ because ___
```
6. Given an array of integers, find if the array contains any duplicates(copies). Explain in details all parts of your solution and their big O complexity.

```python
Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: true

Input: [1,2,3,4]
Output: false

Analysis: the big O notation for this solution is ___ because ___
```
