### HW Problem #1

Write a program to find out your total interest gain at a bank. 

Simple interest formula is given by:

Simple Interest = (P x T x R)/100

Where,

* P is the principle amount

* T is the time and

* R is the rate which is equal to 5

The computer should ask the user for the principle and time you want to put in your money. Where the interest till be 4.5 percent.
Print out the interest amount.

Example OUTPUT (In console):

```
> What is your principle?
3000
> How much time do you want to put in that money (in years)?
5
> Your interest rate will be 150 dollar
```
