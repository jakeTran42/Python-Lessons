1. Write a Python program to get a single string from two given strings, separated by a space and swap the first two characters of each string.

Example

```
Sample String : 'abc', 'xyz'
Expected Result : 'xyc abz'
```

2. Given a paragraph, write a python function that return the number of unique words as well as how many time it appears as a dictionary. (SORT them in alphabetical order for extra challenge #optional)

Example

```
paragraph = "Text is a common form of data, and Python comes with many helpful string methods 
to process the text stored in string values. You will make use of indexing, slicing, and 
string methods in almost every Python program you write."

>>> {"Text": 1, "is": 1, "in": 3, "text": 2 ... etc}
```

3. Write a Python script that takes input from the user and displays that input back in upper and lower cases.

Example
 
```
What's your favourite language? english        

>>> My favourite language is  ENGLISH                                                                             
>>> My favourite language is  english 
```

4. Given a word list, clean up all the words in the list to have no white space and then return the list as a sentence (one string).

Example

```
word_list = ["this", "   is", "a   ", "   sentence   "]

>>> "this is a sentence"

```

5. Write a Python program to get the last part of a string before a specified character.

Example

```
str1 = 'https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e-string/chapter6'

### Get rid of anything right of the last "/"

>>> 'https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e-string'

### Get rid of anything right of "-"

>>> 'https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e'
```
