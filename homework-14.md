### Homework #14

Please use an editor/intepreter to write these programs.

You can use any of the following suggested editors:

```

```

### RECURSION

1. Please read this quick guide on the [Fibonacci Sequence](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/fibonacci-sequence.html). Then write a python recursive function to solve the Fibonacci sequence using recursion.

Example
```
fibonacci(7)

>>> 13

This is the number that the fib sequence place 7 would be in ex. 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13
```

2. Write a Python recursive function to calculate the sum of the positive integers of n+(n-2)+(n-4)... (until n-x =< 0).

Example
```
sum_series(6)
>>> 12 

# The actually math is 6 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 12
```
