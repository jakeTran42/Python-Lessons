### Homework 16

1. Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5,
between 3000 and 3200 (both included).
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

Hints: 
Consider use range(#begin, #end) method

```python
print(divisible())

>>> 2002,2009,2016,2023,2037,2044,2051,2058...
```

2. With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i*i) such that is an integral number between 1 and n (both included). and then the program should print the dictionary.

```python
print(square_integral(1, 5))

>>> {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}
``
