1. Write a Python program to check that a string contains only a certain set of characters (in this case a-z, A-Z and 0-9).

Example

```
"I am a robot"
>>> True

"I @m a r0bo!"
>>> False
```

2. Write a Python program that matches a string that has an 'a' followed by anything, ending in 'b'.

Example:

```
print(text_match("aabbbbd"))
>>> Not matched!

print(text_match("aabAbbbc"))
>>> Not matched! 

print(text_match("accddbbjjjb"))                                                                                                 
>>> Found a match!
```

3. Write a Python program to check for a number at the end of a string.

Example:

```
print(end_num('abcdef'))
>>> False

print(end_num('abcdef6'))
>>> True
```
