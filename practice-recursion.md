1. Write a Python recursive function to calculate the sum of a list of numbers.

```
print(list_sum([2, 4, 5, 6, 7]))

>>> 24
```

2. Given an integer, write a  recursive function that returns true if the given number is palindrome, else false. For example, 12321 is palindrome, but 1451 is not palindrome.
A palindrome is a string or number that can read backward and forward the same.

```
print(is_palindrome(1234321))
>>> True

print(is_palindrome(143321))
>>> False
```

3. Write a password generator in Python. Be creative with how you generate passwords - strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The passwords should be random, generating a new password every time the user asks for a new password. Include your run-time code in a main method.
You do not need to write a recursive function for this.

```
print(generate_password())

>>> duKJNBd43!%
```
