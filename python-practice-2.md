### Problems

1. Create a function that returns the indices of all occurrences of an item in the list.

Examples
```get_indices(["a", "a", "b", "a", "b", "a"], "a") ➞ [0, 1, 3, 5]

get_indices([1, 5, 5, 2, 7], 7) ➞ [4]

get_indices([1, 5, 5, 2, 7], 5) ➞ [1, 2]

get_indices([1, 5, 5, 2, 7], 8) ➞ []
```
Notes
If an element does not exist in a list, return [].
Lists are zero-indexed.
Values in the list will be value-types (don't need to worry about nested lists).

2. Write a function that finds the longest word in a sentence. If two or more words are found, return the first longest word. Characters such as apostophe, comma, period (and the like) count as part of the word (e.g. O'Connor is 8 characters long).

Examples
```longest_word("Hello darkness my old friend.") ➞ "darkness"

longest_word("Hello there mate.") ➞ "Hello"

longest_word("Margaret's toy is plastic.") ➞ "Margaret's"
```
3. John is playing a dice game. The rules are as follows.

Roll two dice.
Add the numbers on the dice together.
Add the total to your overall score.
Repeat this for three rounds.
But if you roll DOUBLES, your score is instantly wiped to 0 and your game ends immediately!

Create a function that takes in a list of tuples as input, and return John's score after his game has ended.

Examples
```dice_game([(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]) ➞ 21

dice_game([(1, 1), (5, 6), (6, 4)]) ➞ 0

dice_game([(4, 5), (4, 5), (4, 5)]) ➞ 27
```

Notes
Ignore all other tuples in the list if a throw happens to be doubles and go straight to returning 0.
John only has two dice and will always give you outcomes for three rounds.

4. Create methods for the Calculator class that can do the following:

Add two numbers.
Subtract two numbers.
Multiply two numbers.
Divide two numbers.

Examples
```calculator = Calculator()

calculator.add(10, 5) ➞ 15

calculator.subtract(10, 5) ➞ 5

calculator.multiply(10, 5) ➞ 50

calculator.divide(10, 5) ➞ 2
```

5. Given a linked list, rotate the list to the right by k places, where k is non-negative.

Example 1:
```
Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL, k = 2
Output: 4->5->1->2->3->NULL
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: 5->1->2->3->4->NULL
rotate 2 steps to the right: 4->5->1->2->3->NULL
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 0->1->2->NULL, k = 4
Output: 2->0->1->NULL
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: 2->0->1->NULL
rotate 2 steps to the right: 1->2->0->NULL
rotate 3 steps to the right: 0->1->2->NULL
rotate 4 steps to the right: 2->0->1->NULL
```
